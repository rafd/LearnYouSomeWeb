### Why Learn Web?


### Intro To Web

#### Website vs. Web App

### CMS vs. Framework

CMS's and Frameworks are both tools that are used to create websites. But what are they, and when should I use each?

"CMS" is an acronym for "Content Management System". They provide abstraction layers of varying levels of complexity for inputing, displaying, and manipulating various forms of data. They can be used for a wide variety of tasks, such as powering blogs, wikis, forums, and many other such sites.

A [web development framework](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_framework) is an abstraction layer which imposes certain rules and conventions to make it easier to develop web applications. 

Frameworks can be made for the front-end as well as the back-end. 

##### Backend Frameworks

There are a wide variety of frameworks, with many different paradigms. Here is a short list of some of the most popular.

+ Ruby
  + [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)
  + [Sinatra](http://rubyonrails.org/)
+ Python
  + [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/)
  + [web.py](http://web.py.org/)
+ PHP
  + [Symfony](http://www.symfony-project.org/)
  + [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org/)
+ Smalltalk
  + [Seaside](http://www.seaside.st/)
+ Perl
  + [Catalyst](http://www.catalystframework.org/)

##### JavaScript Frameworks

+ [Scriptaculous](http://script.aculo.us/)
+ [Mootools](http://mootools.net/)
+ [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
+ [qooxdoo](http://qooxdoo.org/)

Essentially, if you want to store and display primarily textual data, you probably want a CMS. However, if you want to create a more dynamic web app, you probably want a Framework.

### IDEs

IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment and is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of:

+ a source code editor
+ a compiler and/or an interpreter
+ build automation tools
+ a debugger
