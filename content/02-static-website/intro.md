Static Website
==============

Chapter 00: Introduction
------------------------

A static website can be created using three basic tools: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. After a brief overview, each will be covered in more detail in following chapters.

### HTML

HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is a simple markup language, originally based on [SGML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language) (although now, with [XHTML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML), it may be thought of more familiarly as an XML dialect), typically used for displaying online content.

For information, [W3Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) is a good place to start.

### CSS

CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets provides a way to separate the presentation of your website from the content. By keeping all the style information in a CSS file (rather than directly embedding <style> tags or worse, style= attributes), it becomes much easier to maintain a uniform look across a website, as well as easily change the styling when required.

For more information, [W3Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) is a good place to start.

### JavaScript

Javascript (no relation to java) is primarily a client-side scripting language, interpreted by the user's web browser, although it is starting to gain traction as a server-side technology (see [Rhino](http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/) and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)). It is typically used to add dynamic behavior to a website.

The First Project
-----------------

It's time to put what you've learned so far to use. The project for this part of the book is to create a personal website. The following chapters will guide you through exercises to give you the ability and tools to create your own personal static website!
