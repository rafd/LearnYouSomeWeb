Javascript and jQuery
=====================

You can see a short introduction to javascript basics, from last summer's Hacker Academy sessions, [here](http://vimeo.com/12268206).

Once you load a page in your browser, whatever code that generated that page is loaded and stored. A server has generated that page and sent it to your browser and it is stored in your browser.

Developers were a bit unsatisfied with the fact that once a page was loaded, nothing could be changed afterwards. Thus something that eventually grew into Javascript was born.

Javascript is used to add interactivity to a site. It lets the page still interact with you and server after a page has been loaded in your browser.
